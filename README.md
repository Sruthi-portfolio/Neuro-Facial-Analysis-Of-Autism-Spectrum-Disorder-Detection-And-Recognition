# Neuro-Facial-Analysis-Of-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-Detection-And-Recognition

This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system for early Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) detection. The goal is to create a non-invasive and accessible tool to support healthcare professionals in diagnosing ASD, particularly in areas with limited access to specialized expertise.

# Project Overview
ASD diagnosis typically involves subjective clinical evaluation, which can be time-consuming and inaccessible in certain regions. To address this, the project combines facial image analysis and clinical screening data to enhance the accuracy and speed of detection. The system analyzes facial features and behavioral data, aiding in early diagnosis and personalized care plans for ASD patients.

# Problem Solved
The main challenge this project tackles is improving the early detection of ASD using non-invasive methods. Early diagnosis is critical for timely intervention, especially in children, but current diagnostic methods are often inaccessible in remote areas. This project aims to bridge that gap by utilizing both behavioral and facial recognition data, offering a more comprehensive detection method.

# Algorithms and Models
Several machine learning algorithms were implemented and compared in this project:

Support Vector Machine (SVM): Achieved the highest accuracy at 98%.
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gaussian Naive Bayes

# Data Sources
Facial Images: Extracted from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Clinical Screening Data: Obtained from a Kaggle dataset focusing on different age groups, including toddlers, children, adolescents, and adults.

# Key Features
Non-invasive diagnosis: Utilizes image-based facial recognition and behavioral screening for early detection.
Accessible tool: Designed to be used in regions with limited medical resources.
Multi-age group compatibility: Analyzes data from toddlers to adults.

# Results
The SVM model demonstrated the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 98% in predicting ASD. Other algorithms also showed promising results, providing multiple diagnostic avenues.
